# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Repository Structure and Purpose

The root of this repository is primarily for **documentation, editing templates, and detailed specifications** for app ideas using the Four Part Vibe method. 

**Important: There is nothing to build** in the root directory of this repository.

## Project Organization

Each top-level folder in this repository represents a separate project, and some of those projects may contain buildable code with their own specific requirements and build processes.

## Working Within Projects

If you're working within a specific project (top-level folder), please refer to that folder's own instructions and documentation. GitHub Copilot should focus on one project at a time, following the conventions and requirements specific to that project.

## Development Methodology

All work in this repository should generally follow the **Four Part Vibe coding method** as described in the referenced video tutorial. This methodology emphasizes:

1. **Planning & Vision** - Define project goals, requirements, and architecture
2. **Experimentation & Exploration** - Build prototypes and validate assumptions
3. **Implementation & Building** - Create production-quality code incrementally
4. **Reflection & Refinement** - Evaluate outcomes and plan improvements

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this repository:

- Follow the Four Part Vibe methodology for any new projects or features
- Respect the documentation-first approach of the root repository
- For project-specific work, adhere to the individual project's guidelines
- Maintain the clear separation between planning/documentation and implementation phases
