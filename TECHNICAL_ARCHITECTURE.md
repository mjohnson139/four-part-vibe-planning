## Questions & Clarifications

* How do you envision the AI coaching to evolve during a session - should it respond to user input/feedback or follow a predetermined script with variations?
* What level of offline functionality is required - should users be able to complete full sessions without any internet connection?
* For practitioner discovery, do you want to integrate with existing practitioner directories or build a proprietary network?
* What are your specific privacy requirements beyond local-first storage - do you need HIPAA compliance for health data?
* How do you want to handle user authentication if data is primarily local - anonymous usage or account-based with cloud backup?
* What's your preferred approach for handling app updates that might affect locally stored AI models or session data?
* Do you want to support multiple breathing techniques in MVP or focus solely on the 5-second inhale/exhale pattern?
* How should the app handle interruptions during sessions (calls, notifications, app backgrounding)?

## List of Architecture Consideration Questions

* How will you handle data synchronization across multiple devices while maintaining local-first privacy principles?
* What's your strategy for scaling the OpenAI API costs as you approach 100K users with frequent AI interactions?

* What's your approach to handling different platform-specific features (iOS vs Android) while maintaining code reuse?
* How will you manage database migrations and schema changes as the app evolves with local SQLite storage?
* What monitoring and observability strategy will you implement to track app performance and user experience at scale?
* How will you handle versioning and backward compatibility for local data structures as features evolve?
* What's your disaster recovery plan for the backend services and how will it affect local-first functionality?
* How will you implement efficient batch processing for analytics while respecting user privacy preferences?
* What's your strategy for managing third-party service dependencies and fallback mechanisms when they're unavailable?
* How will you handle the complexity of real-time features (video calls, synchronized sessions) while maintaining the local-first approach?
* What performance optimization strategies will you implement for the React Native app to ensure smooth breathing session experiences?
* How will you manage the trade-offs between feature richness and app size, especially for users with limited device storage?
* What's your approach to implementing A/B testing and feature flags in a local-first architecture?
* How will you handle compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA) with your local-first data approach while still enabling necessary analytics?
