The system architecture demonstrates a comprehensive mobile-first approach with local-first privacy principles, hybrid cloud integration, and scalable backend services designed to support up to 100K users.

## Questions & Clarifications

* What specific breathing techniques beyond the basic 5-second inhale/exhale should be included in the MVP?
* Should the AI coaching prompts be pre-generated and cached locally, or generated in real-time during sessions?
* What level of practitioner verification is required (certifications, background checks, etc.)?
* How should the app handle users who want to practice longer than 3 minutes in the MVP?
* Should there be any integration with existing health apps or wearables in the MVP?
* What age restrictions or safety considerations should be implemented for breathing exercises?
* How should the app handle network connectivity issues during practitioner booking?
* What specific analytics events should be tracked while maintaining privacy?
