## Architecture Overview

This layered architecture diagram illustrates the Breath Work Companion App's system design following standard enterprise architecture patterns, with clear separation of concerns across six distinct layers:

### üì± Presentation Layer
The user-facing mobile application built with React Native and Expo, providing cross-platform compatibility and rich user interactions. Includes integrated audio playback, notification management, and local storage capabilities for offline functionality.

### üîê Authentication & Gateway Layer
Central authentication and API gateway services providing secure access control and request routing. Supabase Auth handles user authentication with OAuth provider integration for seamless login experiences.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Application Services Layer
High-performance FastAPI backend server containing core business logic across specialized microservices for practitioners, bookings, sessions, and analytics. Designed for horizontal scaling and maintainability.

### üåê External Services Layer
Third-party integrations providing specialized capabilities including AI-powered coaching (OpenAI), secure payments (Stripe), analytics (PostHog), video calling, and push notifications.

### üíæ Data Layer
Hybrid data storage strategy with local SQLite for privacy-sensitive user data and cloud PostgreSQL for shared resources. CDN provides optimized delivery of audio content and static assets.

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Layer
Azure App Service provides scalable cloud hosting with Docker containerization, load balancing, and auto-scaling capabilities to support growth to 100K+ users.

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns across presentation, gateway, service, data, and infrastructure layers
2. **Local-First Privacy**: Core user data and progress stored locally in the presentation layer
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized entry point for all backend communications and authentication
4. **Microservices Approach**: Modular backend services for scalability and maintainability
5. **Hybrid Cloud Model**: Strategic use of cloud services only where shared data is required
6. **Cross-Platform Efficiency**: React Native + Expo for unified iOS and Android development
7. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Azure App Service with containerization for elastic scaling to 100K+ users

## Data Flow

The system follows a clear top-down data flow through the layered architecture:

1. **User Interaction**: Mobile app captures user input and displays responses
2. **Gateway Routing**: API Gateway routes requests and validates authentication  
3. **Business Logic**: Application services process requests and apply business rules
4. **External Integration**: Services communicate with third-party APIs for specialized functions
5. **Data Persistence**: Local SQLite for personal data, cloud PostgreSQL for shared data
6. **Infrastructure**: Containerized services on Azure with automatic scaling and load balancing

This architecture ensures data privacy through local-first storage while enabling collaborative features through selective cloud integration.
