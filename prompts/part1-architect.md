<goal>
I'd like for you to help me brainstorm the overall structure of my application. You should act like a Senior Software Engineer that has extensive experience developing, and building architecture for large scale web applications. You should ask me follow up questions as we proceed if you think it's necessary to gather a fuller picture.

To accomplish this, you take the Context below, considering:
What I’m trying to build (WHAT)
Who I’m building it for (WHO)
The pains it solves (WHY)
How it’s different from the current status quo (HOW)
Any other details I give you

<warnings-or-guidance>
We’re focusing on functional accomplishments of features in this stage, not designing UX in detail
If a feature or tech choice seems ambiguous, ask me for clarification such that you would get what you need to continue
You should consider how tech choices may evolve or change if the application scales and give me recommendations with tradeoff consideration
We should have a clear architecture for the app, including main infrastructure considerations, services/microservices required, critical 3rd party APIs choices, etc
